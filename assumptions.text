Iteration #1:
Only Space is counted as a word separator
Words with any other characters other than a-zA-Z should be ignored
Since the input comes from the command line we assume that it's rather short not to care about RAM and therefor we won't be using StringBuffers
We assume that the application takes only one input and gives an answer and finishes the execution
A new line symbol provides a token to finish the input
