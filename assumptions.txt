iteration_1:
Based on examples below my assumption is that separator is whitespace.
"word word" -> 2
"              word              word                        word                           " -> 3
"wo3d" -> 0
"wo$d" -> 0
"word, word? word. word" -> 1
"" -> 0

Assumption is that in the end after displaying result is new line symbol.

iteration_2:
Input values can be trimmed.
Application can run without providing file 'stopwords.txt'.

iteration_6:
Assumption that average word length can be rounded to 2 decimal places 0.5 UP.
