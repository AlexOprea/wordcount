Assumptions:
    - words are separated by one or more spaces (' ');
    - we assume that we do not want to have legacy code ( the iteration 1 word validator ), hence we modify the previous implementation;
    - stopwords will be a file within the project which is read from when the application starts;
    - for simplicity we will assume that the stopwords file will not change during execution;
