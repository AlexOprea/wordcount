The following spacing characters will be accepted and handled:
* Whitespace
* Tab
* Newline
* Comma
* "Thinking"-Dash

Testing will be done with default input character encoding.

Only Words (A-Za-z) will be counted, other substrings consisting only of other characters will be not counted as words!
Strings containing a letter (A-Za-z) will be regarded as words (e.g. "What?", "$cool") only containing those (e.g. "§$€") do not count.
