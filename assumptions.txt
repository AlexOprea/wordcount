This is quite simple but yet pretty extendable implementation for the requested words counter application
It has 3 main workflow objects:
1. Modifier - modifies the input word, for example, if we need to clean a word, like remove the dot at the end, or whatever
2. Filter - check if the word is valid
3. Aggregator - perform aggregation on each word, like count words

Source of information is provided through Source interface, it can be console, file or anything
WordsProcessor will get data from the source, split each line around SPACE (\ s), apply all modifications for each word,
test it against all available filter and if the word is OK will perform aggregation

The result of the processor work is a State object. Which contains all calculated information and can be used later
to print out it or use it later in further calculations
