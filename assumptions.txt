Assumptions:
    - words are separated by one or more spaces (' ');
    - we assume that we do not want to have legacy code ( the iteration 1 word validator ), hence we modify the previous implementation;
    - stopwords will be a file within the project which is read from when the application starts;
    - for simplicity we will assume that the stopwords file will not change during execution;
    - we assume that if the user supplies an invalid filename an exception is thrown and the program will not continue;
    - for iteration 4 we assume that the the words can also be spltied by exactly one dash: "-"
            Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
    - Here we have 9 words and 7 unique words, taking the stopwords into consideration we assume that now words can also end with exactly one "." ( aka end of sentence)
