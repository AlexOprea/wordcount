I had an assumption that we will give a message for the user to telling him to provide input
I had an other assumption that the user will always respond.
I had the assumption that the user input will be one line.
I had the assumption that separator can be any whitespace and nothing else
I had the assumption that a word what contains something what is not a letter is invalid and should be counted as 0 word
I had the assumption that the stopwords.txt is provided in the same directory as the application
I had the assumption that if the stopwords.txt is not provided we should count the words like it was an empty list
