Iteration 1:
* Any number of spaces should not be counted as word. To be able to support multiple sentences also with dot at the end, I decided to replace '.' with ' '

Itteration 2:
* Support stopwords case insensitively. Words in stopwords.txt can be written also with camel case, upper case also in the sentence, cause they are compared as lowercase.
