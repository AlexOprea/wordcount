Iteration 1:
Interfaces and implementations are documented using a Design-by-contract approach
Interface documentation is general, whereas documentation on implementations specifies details

Iteration 2:
Stopwords should be case-insensitive and spaces in the stopwords input should be ignored
If the stopwords input cannot be loaded then no stopwords are assumed
