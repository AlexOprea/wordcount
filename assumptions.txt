I have misunderstood the idea of reading params, and I am passing the input string as a variable.

I am not familiar with jUnit5 Assertions, that's why I am doing my assertion in that way

Assertions.assertTrue(stopWords.containsAll(expected) && expected.containsAll(stopWords));

I have decided to create mytext.txt file in resources directory,
 because of hardcoded implementation of FileStructureRepository
