- Words are separated with whitespaces
- Word consists of letters [a-zA-z]
- If consecutive characters contain invalid character (not [a-zA-z]), stretch of characters is not considered to be word



Iteration 2
- Stop words have the same rules as words in text - must contain only [a-zA-z], otherwise the stop word is ignored
- A line in stopwords.txt can contain only one stop word
