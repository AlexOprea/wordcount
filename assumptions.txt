Iteration 1
I will counto only "words" which is consinst from a-zA-Z letters, so input "pavel1marek" this is not word.
I will use space (32) and tabs (9) as charatcters to split input into entities.



Iteration 2
I assume, that file stopwords.txt is mandatory to run WordCounter.
I assume, that this file is not part of delivery and filename is stored in properties file (to enable change of filename in target installation).
If some exception occurs, than I catch it in main class and write to output.

With TomasR I change assumption, that I prefer file soptwords.txt is located in resource directory.
