Iteration 1:
- One ore more white spaces are the only delimiter how words are split.
- Words are only considered as stretches of letters ([a-z][A-Z])
- If the word contains any other character, then it won't be consider as word

Iteration 3:
- In case a filename is provided, but a FileNotFoundException has occurred,
then the application will throw a FileNotFoundException and exit immediately

Iteration 5:
- With the current Word validator service the "text-" and "-text" is also considered as a word.
In case it cant be done so regarding the requirements the possible solution can be to have an advanced
regular expression.
last commit was pushed to the iteration 4 but it contains solutions for the iteration 5
