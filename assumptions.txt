Assumption 1. according to the spec, I assume that there are no umlauts. (word is a stream of A-Za-z)

Assumption 2. normaly I would use the logging library, but for the purpose of this test I am using System.out.println()

Assumption 3. I am assuming that the file name and the location will be given in the program, and in the case that the file
is not given, or not placed at the proper location, I would not stop the program, just provide an erro message.
