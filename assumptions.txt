Iteration 1

Delimitation: " " (space)
Contains: a-zA-Z characters

Iteration 4

I should replace the ". " and "-" with " ".
If the last character of the text contains a "." I can remove it.

Iteration 5

I integrated in the letter only regex, the possibility to take words which also contain a hyphen
Before:"^[a-zA-Z]+$"
After:"^[a-zA-Z\\-]+$"
