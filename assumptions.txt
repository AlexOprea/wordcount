Iteration1:
hi hi-- space character is the words separator, multiple spaces will still be counted as one.
Input is not super long.
Iteration2:
"stopwords.txt" file is part of the application and not provided by the user.
I think the user should only decide the input and not how/what the application should behave.
Stopwords are case-sensitive
Iteration3;
There is only one argument and it is the file name. The file name parameter is the absolute path to the file.
We still use stop words here.
Iteration4:
Words can end with "." and we still count them.
"-" is a valid word separator
Iteration5:
Words can still end with .
Words "-" are valid
Iteration6:
The average is rounded up to 2.
Average is calculated from all words.
