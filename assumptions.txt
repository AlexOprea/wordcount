Iteration 1:
* Any number of spaces should not be counted as word. To be able to support multiple sentences also with dot at the end, I decided to replace '.' with ' '

Iteration 2:
* Support stopwords case insensitively. Words in stopwords.txt can be written also with camel case, upper case also in the sentence, cause they are compared as lowercase.

Iteration 3:
* Try to find entered file in the root of app and also in the 'input/' directory

Iteration 4:
* from the iteration 1 it was defined that words are stretches of letters (a-zA-Z), no dash was defined as part of word, so from my
point of view word 'Humpty-Dumpty' is not correct word when we use space as splitter for word and follow rules from iteration 1.
