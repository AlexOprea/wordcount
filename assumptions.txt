wordcount will be an int.
i know regex better than i actually do
I was assuming, until i was corrected, that the code from iteration one has to still be available with/ from next iterations
i do not filter out the words that start with a stop word
From iteration 3: if the filename is provided but it is incorrect, the application should stop
