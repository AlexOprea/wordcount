# Iteration 1

The following spacing characters will be accepted and handled:
* Whitespace
* Tab
* Newline
* Comma
* "Thinking"-Dash

Testing will be done with default input character encoding.

Only Words (A-Za-z) will be counted, other substrings consisting only of other characters will be not counted as words!
Strings containing a letter (A-Za-z) will be regarded as words (e.g. "What?", "$cool") only containing those (e.g. "§$€") do not count.

# Iteration 2

Assumption that 'stopwords.txt' is included in the resources!

Words are case sensetive and therefore "A" will be a different word from "a".

# Iteration 3

Assumption that 'mytext.txt' (or any other file) is included in the resources or the full path is supplied!

# Iteration 5

Made an mistake in iteration 4 and handled dash-separated words incorrectly.

# Iteration 6

Will only print up to 2 digits after the decimal point.

# Iteration 7

Assuming that it's valid to supply multiple times the '-index' option and that this option may be on any position in the argument list!
