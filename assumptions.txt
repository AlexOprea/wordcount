In the first iteration the system input from the user has to be read.

Iteration 4:
"unique words" means that each word is only count once (stopwords are still excluded)


Iteration 6:
characters such as dots, commas and semicolons should not be considered and will therefore be excluded form the average calculation.
In the sample file "sometext.txt" we have a sum of 36 characters and an amount of 7 words which would be an average characters length of 5,1428..
