no handling of special characters like, `,'"`
user provides 1 input and then program quits

iteration - 2
stopwords.txt are present in classpath and not provided from user

iteration - 3
the input file assumed to be present under repo root
there can be only 1 argument from command line

iteration - 4
calculating unique words are not optional feature. always to be calculated.
assuming input file fits into the memory
assume additionally: hyphen is also a word separator. e.g -> Humpty-Dumpty
full-stop at the end is not causing word to be ignored. e.g -> wall.
assuming multiple full-stops will be ignored e.g -> wall.. then skip it

iteration - 5
more than 1 hyphen is a ignored word. e.g : Humpty--Dumpty is ignored
hyphen alone is ignored
words beginning or ending with hyphen are ignored. e.g: -humpty or humpty-

iteration - 6
assuming average will work over the number of words. not the unique ones.
calculating average is not an optional feature. will always be calculated.
will print 2 decimals numbers. and will use javas RoundingMode.HALF_UP
return 0 if no words are found
count also hyphen in between words
not counting full-stop at the end of the word. e.g-> full. has length 4 not 5 (because of dot)
always keep 2 decimals even they are 0. e.g -> 3.00 is included in the output
