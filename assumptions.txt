# Iteration One Assumptions

only words with [a-z,A-Z] are counted as words
words are deliniated witha ' ' (space) char at the end of the string
no special chars or numbers are allowed to be in a word - eg: word1 == invalid

word 1
word word 2
word word word 3
word1word 0
word.word......word 0
word. word, word! 0
word$word foo bar 2


# Iteration 6 Assumptions
the average is always calculated against the total number of words (excluding stop words).
