Word counter
============
Application to count the number of words in a text. 
The app will ask the user for the text upon start. 
It will then output the number of words found in the text. 
Words are stretches of letters (a-z,A-Z). Sample usage:

    $ wordcount
        Enter text: Mary had a little lamb
        Number of words: 5

Not all words are relevant for counting. A list of stop words can be provided in the stopword.txt reource file - new line separated.
