# Assumptions

- Words are strings of characters [a-zA-Z] of length >= 1 separated by whitespace characters (defined by RegExp)
- Invalid character combinations, e.g. "wo2rd", are ignored.
- CLI file name argument is a absolute or relative file path.
- Erroneous file path arguments (e.g. if file does not exist ) are not handled. I assume that for now standard Java stack-trace output is good enough.
