Trade-Offs:

Iteration 1 9:30 - 11:30
Separation of concerns: UI - BL decoupled only by extracted method
Invalid alphabet; Current solution splits by white space (all words)

Iteration 2 11:30 - 12:30
BL is still not extracted
Missing structure of code
Rewrite BL to stream pipeline
 - File IO Helper abstraction DRY
 - more generic method abstractions it should not matter if the input are an array of words filtered by an array of stopWords.

Iteration 3 14:00 - 15:00
There is no extraction into an adapter pattern for the input IO part (loss of previous functionality)
switch to command pattern instead of static method call (pipelining)

Iteration 4 15:00 - 16:00
Same issues as above need for better decoupling and abstraction
