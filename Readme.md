1) console application
2) fail with error message with wrong input
3) words are separated by 'space'
4) we use only text without special characters like dots

We have added functionality for filtering unneccesary stop words (InputTestValidator)
We have added test for reading stopwords.txt file and providing requested list of stop words.
We have added possibility to provide input from program argument, 
if missing there is still possibility provide input from console.
